A Graphical User Interface created with <i>Julia Genie Builder</i> made for to assist in the use of this repository: https://github.com/CINVESTAV-LABI/julia_mzML_imzML which generates images with the mzMl, imzML and ibd files.<br />

Then open a <b>Julia</b> terminal on the directory <i>"Julia_msi_GUI"</i> and put the next code, this is needed every time you want to run the GUI: <br />
